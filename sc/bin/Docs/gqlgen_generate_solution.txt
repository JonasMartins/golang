When you follow the tutorial, you end up with a folder graph and a file resolver.go inside it. In it, you add //go:generate go run github.com/99designs/gqlgen and to make it work, you add //go:generate go get github.com/99designs/gqlgen/cmd@v0.14.0 right before that. For reference, this is how my resolver.go looks like:

package graph

//go:generate go get github.com/99designs/gqlgen/cmd@v0.14.0
//go:generate go run github.com/99designs/gqlgen

type Resolver struct{}

So adding those two lines at src/graph/resolver.go

and running at src dir:

go generate ./...

solves the problem, but, it is needed to clear the file schema.resolvers.go with the 
schema's old version.
